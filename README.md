### Data Cleaning & Preparation
Using Power Query Editor, the following data cleaning and preparation procedures were performed:
**1. Created New Columns:** Some of the new columns that were added to the dataset include:
- **Month Name:** This column was extracted from the "Date of Purchase" Column.

   DAX Code: `Month Name = FORMAT(railway[Date of Purchase].[Date],"MMM")`
- **Month No:** This column was extracted from the "Date of Purchase" Column.

  DAX Code: `Month No = MONTH(railway[Date of Purchase])`
- **Route:** This column was created by combining the "Departure Station" and "Arrival Destination" column together.

   DAX Code: `Route = railway[Departure Station] & " - " & railway[Arrival Destination]`
- **Departure Hour12:** This column was extracted from the "Departure Time" Column.

   DAX Code: `DepartureHour12 = 
IF(
    HOUR([Departure Time]) = 0 || HOUR([Departure Time]) = 12,
    12.00,
    MOD(HOUR([Departure Time]), 12) + 0.00
)`
- **Departure Hour24:** This column was extracted from the "Departure Time" Column.

  DAX Code: `DepartureHour24 = FORMAT(HOUR([Departure Time]), "00.00")`

**2. Created New Measues**
The following DAX Measures were created:
- **Total Revenue:** Thus calculates the total revenue generated from ticket purchases by summing the Price column.

  DAX Code: `Total Revenue = SUM(railway[Price])`
- **Average Ticket Price:** This computes the average price of all tickets sold, providing insight into typical ticket costs.

  DAX Code: `AVG Ticket Price = AVERAGE(railway[Price])`
- **Total Tickets Purchased:** This counts the number of unique ticket transactions, indicating total tickets purchased.

  DAX Code: `Total No of Tickets Purchased = DISTINCTCOUNT(railway[Transaction ID])`
- **Delayed Journey Count:** This returns the number of journeys that were marked as delayed in the dataset.

  DAX Code: `Delayed Journey = COUNTROWS(FILTER('railway',railway[Journey Status]="Delayed"))`
- **Refund Request Count:** This counts how many passengers requested a refund, helping assess service issues.

  DAX Code: `Refund Requests = COUNTROWS(FILTER(railway, railway[Refund Request]= "Yes"))`
- **Total No of Stations:** This measures the number of unique departure stations, giving insight into network reach and station usage.

  DAX Code: `Total Stations = DISTINCTCOUNT(railway[Departure Station])`

### Key KPIs
- **Total Revenue:** $741,921
- **Total Tickets Purchased:** 31,653
- **Average Ticket Price:** $23.44
- **Total Stations:** 12
- **Total Delayed Journeys:** 2,292
- **Total Refund Requests:** 1,118

### Key Analytics & Insights
**1.	 Ticket Revenue by Station**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Ticket%20Revenue%20by%20Station.png)

**Insight:** London Kings Cross generated the highest revenue (~$200K), followed by Liverpool Lime Street ($135K) and London Euston ($112K).

**Problem:** Heavy revenue concentration in a few stations might indicate dependence on limited routes.

**Recommendation:** Diversify promotional efforts to boost underperforming stations. Consider additional services or offers from mid-tier stations to expand revenue base.



**2. Most Popular Route Taken**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Most%20Popular%20Route%20Taken.png)

**Insight:** The most frequented route is Manchester Piccadilly â†’ Liverpool Lime Street (4.6K journeys), followed by London Euston â†’ Birmingham New Street (4.2K).

**Problem:** High demand routes may face congestion, reduced service quality, or maintenance strain.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize infrastructure, train capacity, and service frequency on top routes. Introduce loyalty or dynamic pricing strategies to manage load.

**3. Total Revenue by Ticket Types**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Total%20Revenue%20by%20Ticket%20Type.png)

**Insight:**
â€¢	Advance tickets generated the highest revenue.
â€¢	Off-Peak tickets sold in high volume, but at lower average prices.
â€¢	Anytime tickets provided a balanced contribution.

**Problem:** While Advance tickets are profitable, dependence on pre-booking might limit spontaneous travelers.

**Recommendation:** Enhance pricing strategies by balancing promotions across all ticket types. Consider limited-time discounts for Off-Peak and Anytime options to drive volume.

**4. Monthly Ticket Purchase Trends**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Monthly%20Ticket%20Purchase.png)

**Insight:** January led in ticket sales (205K), followed by March (195K) and April (187K). A sharp drop in December (1K) could be due to holiday season, data cutoff, or reduced services.

**Problem:** Seasonality affects revenue forecasting and staffing.

**Recommendation:** Prepare flexible staffing and marketing for peak months. Investigate Decemberâ€™s dipâ€”if due to reduced services, ensure communication to minimize customer dissatisfaction.

**5. Journey Status Breakdown**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Passenger's%20Journey%20Status.png)

**Insight:** 86.82% of journeys were on time, while 7.24% were cancelled and 5.94% were delayed.

**Problem:** Nearly 13% of journeys experienced disruptionâ€”this affects trust and can trigger refund claims or negative feedback.

**Recommendation:** Investigate delay and cancellation causes. Implement predictive maintenance, improve scheduling, and boost transparency via real-time updates.

**6. Peak Travel Hours**

![](https://github.com/Ujunwajohn01/Railway-Analysis-/blob/main/Peak%20Travel%20Times.png)

**Insight:**

- Highest ridership occurs at 06:00, 07:00, 17:00, and 18:00, with 3K+ passengers each.
- Lowest traffic appears between 11:00â€“15:00.

**Problem:** Uneven distribution of passengers causes overcrowding and resource underutilization.

**Recommendation:** Promote off-peak travel with discounted fares or flexible ticketing. Increase train frequency or seating during peak hours to maintain comfort and punctuality.
